#### Deployment Prework

Complete the steps below before Thursday class.

1.  Register a credit card on Heroku - this is needed to use the mongo lab plugin - you won't be charged anything.  Go to https://heroku.com/verify.  You can read more here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mongolab.  NOTE: You don't need to set up an account on mlabs to use the add on in Heroku.

2.  Create a master repo on github that contains your API project with tests in a working mode.  The root of this project should contain an .eslintrc and .eslintrcignore file.  It should also contain a .gitignore file.  The .eslintrc, .eslintrcignore, and .gitnore files are provided with the markdown doc.  

3.  Your project (that you set up in 2 above) for this deployment class should pass when you call `eslint *` from the root CLI and your mocha tests should pass.  Check in with TA's/Instructors before class if you have a problem with this.
